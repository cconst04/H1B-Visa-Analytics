Many international students like us come to the US to get the chance to study at the top universities. Moreover, it's very common that we then want to stay in the US for a while to put our newly gained skills into practice at the most prestigious companies. By doing this, we can learn from industry leaders and recover the money we invested in our education. So we work using our Optional Practical Training (OPT) for a few years and then what? Most people we know ambivalent. They feel gratitude for what they have accomplished but feel a void because it's over. After experiencing life in the US with such a rich culture and a plethora of opportunities, it's painful to accept the reality to leave, so many look for another way to stay. Enter, the H1B visa.

The H1B visa allows employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. That is jobs that require specialized knowledge and at least a bachelor's degree. H1B visa holders can stay working in the US for three years, extendable to six years. However, after some time, H1B visa holders can apply for a green card, which is the main reason why this visa appeals to most people.

Unfortunately, not all people have the profile to apply for an H1B visa, and not all companies sponsor these visas for their employees. This begs the following questions: where do I stand? Is my profile good enough to apply for this visa? If so, which kind of companies would be willing to sponsor my visa?
