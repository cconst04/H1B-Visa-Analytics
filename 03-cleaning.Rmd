# Data transformation
## Fields cleaning
- Some of the fields had html elements and we cleaned them using regular expressions  
- Some numeric fields were malformatted with text. We removed it with regular expressions  
- For some years, wage from and wage to were merged in one column with "-" separator. We splitted it in two columns  
- Each year had an inconsistent column name. We selected only the columns that were valuable for our graphs and renamed them consistently 
- 2020 was split in four quarters, so we merged it to only one  
  
## Units conversion
- The employees wage was of varying units:hourly, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, yearly. For this reason we created a new yearly and an hourly field. For the conversion of hourly to yearly payment we found that at average a person works for 1800 hours per year, source: <>. For monthly to hourly conversion we found that someone works for 173 hours per month on average, source:<>. Also, we assumed that an average US employee works 5 days per week for 8 hours per day
